# Data Zoo

Unidiomatic go? Maybe. Ergonomic? Definitely.

Data Zoo is a conglomerate of different tools and ideas to manipulate data for very specific
usecases (inspecting microservices, run e2e tests, ...). It might not be the most efficient
in terms of memory or cpu usage, nonetheless it is effective in what it does: work with data.

## Building
